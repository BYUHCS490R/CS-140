        <h1>History of Tesla</h1>

        <h2>Founding of Tesla</h2>
        <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by engineers who decided to show that electric cars could be better than gasoline cars in performance, security, and aesthetics. The first pair was Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning while the next trio was Elon Musk, JB Straubel, and Ian Wright. Ever since, Tesla's main ambition has been to accelerate the transformation of the world with energy that is clean.</p>
