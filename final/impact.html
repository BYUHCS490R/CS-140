            <p>The Impact Report of Tesla for the year 2024 gives a comprehensive view of the steps taken the goal which is to make the world fully depend on sustainable energy faster. The report points out that the electric cars of Tesla are much more environmentally friendly than the traditional gasoline vehicles not only during the operational period but also the entire life cycle that includes the production of the vehicle and the disposal of the vehicle. In addition, Tesla is double-checking on its safety claim and indicating its full trust in safety features to an extent that it would offer skimming prices on its cars if the model proves not to be the safest. In support of this, Tesla cites crash-tests that place it on top, and among other factors that contribute to human driving being less safe than Autopilot technology are the significantly lower car-fire rates and the approximately ten times more safe driving by Autopilot than by man.</p>

            <p>Tesla is not only moving but also spinning areas of clean energy around the globe with their clean energy sources and grid augmentation through Megapack and Virtual Power Plants. Such solutions make it possible to cut back on fossil fuels and offer support to cities during peak hours and outages. Furthermore, the company is tackling issues like supply chain efficiency, employer security, and responsible sourcing of raw materials along with battery recycling programs, etc. With all these mentioned factors, Tesla enumerates a holistic approach that will help to obviate the negative impact of their products, operations, and supply chain on the environment while creating a sustainable energy ecosystem for the future.</p>
