    <h1>Engagement - Git and GitHub Help</h1>
    <p>1. How do you get help?

    </p>
    <p>You can email the teacher or the TA.</p>

    <p>2. What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?

    </p>
    <p>They are due at 11:59pm on the day we have class. You cannot turn it in late but canvas automatically removes your 4 lowest score.</p>

    <p>3. What time are projects due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?

    </p>
    <p>They are due 11:59pm on the day. Projects are due at 5am the next day. </p>

    <p>4. Describe the tags we discussed today. Remember, you can look at the lecture notes for a video that reviews what we discussed.

    </p>
    <p>DOCTYPE says what type of html we are using. head contains things that don't show up on the webpage but sets up the page. Body tag contains what you will see on the webpage. h1 makes the words as a heading in the biggest font </p>

    <p>5. Paste the link to your web page. If you don't get it working, paste your questions. See the tutors tonight for help.</p>
