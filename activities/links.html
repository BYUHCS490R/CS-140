        <h3>2. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h3>
        <p>The root is the starting spot of the website's files. A path shows the location of a file inside folders. Folders organize files into groups. File names are the final target at the end of the path.</p>

        <p>Instead of having the list of all the files, you get a website that serves as a home page.</p>

        <h3>4. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p>An absolute link links to a different website. A relative link is usually a link that leads to a different part of the website. You can type the url instead of typing the whole domain name.</p>
