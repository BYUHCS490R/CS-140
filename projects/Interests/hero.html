        <p>David Kalakaua was the last king of Hawaii. He was born on November 16, 1836 and died on January 20, 1891. He was known as the "Merrie Monarch" because he loved to throw big parties and celebrations. He was a big supporter of Hawaiian culture and traditions, and he helped to revive hula, which had been banned by missionaries in the 19th century. On his corronation day, he went underground and talked to the all the different kumu hulas because they were practicing in secret as hula was banned and invited their halau to dance on his coronation day.</p>
