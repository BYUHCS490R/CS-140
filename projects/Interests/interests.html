        <h2 class="start">Types of hula</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of hula, hula kahiko and hula auana.</p>
        <p>The traditional style of hula is called hula kahiko and it's a more serious type of hula where the dancers don't smile because that's how they were thaught to portray this style of hula. For hula kahiko, the dancers are dancing to a chant using the pahu drum.</p>
        <p>The other style is called hula auana and it's a more modern style of hula. Foreigners came to the islands in the late 1700s and introducted new music and stringed instruments and with that, hula auana was creates. In this style, you will see the dancers smiling, showing more emotions and are dancing while people are singing songs and using stringed instruments.</p>
